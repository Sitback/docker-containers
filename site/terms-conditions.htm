In the event of a fault in Service, you must report the fault by telephone or electronic mail HudHosting's Technical Support at the appropriate numbers or addresses or other such numbers or addresses that HudHosting may from time to time provide. Upon receipt of the fault report, HudHosting will take all proper steps without undue delay to correct the fault.

					<p>5.6 HudHosting Service Level Agreement for 'Business Hosting' Service and 'Business Pro Hosting':</p>
					<p>5.6.1 Service Availability - HudHosting's Service Level Agreement (SLA) is to have the Hosting located at Karlsruhe available 99.5% of the time.</p>
					<p>5.6.2 Service Level Agreement - At the Customer's request, HudHosting will calculate the Customer's "Service Unavailability" in a calendar month. "Service Unavailability" consists of the number of minutes that the HudHosting Hosting located at Karlsruhe was not available to the Customer in excess of the 0.5% permitted unavailability, and includes unavailability associated with any maintenance at any HudHosting node other than Scheduled Maintenance. Outages will be counted as Service Unavailability only if the Customer reports an outage to HudHosting support by telephone or email within five days of the outage. Service Unavailability will not include Scheduled Maintenance, unavailability of individual Services (such as email, webserver or other user-configurable application) or any unavailability resulting from (a) the Customer's applications, equipment, or facilities, (b) acts or omissions of the Customer, or any use or user of the Service authorized by the Customer or (c) reasons of Force Majeure or other circumstances beyond HudHosting's reasonable control (as defined in clause 13 of these terms).</p>
					<p>5.6.3 Compensation - For each complete hour of Service Unavailability, in excess of the 0.5% permitted unavailability, in any calendar month, at the Customer's request the Customer's account shall be credited for the pro-rated charges for one day of the HudHosting Monthly Fee for the Service with respect to which this SLA has not been met.</p>
					<p>5.6.4 Scheduled Maintenance - "Scheduled Maintenance" shall mean any maintenance at any HudHosting node of which the Customer is notified 48 hours in advance, and maintenance that is performed during a standard maintenance window from 2 AM to 6 AM local time on any HudHosting node.</p>
					<p>5.6.5 The Customer is solely responsible for providing HudHosting with accurate and current contact information for the Customer's designated points of contact. HudHosting will be relieved of its obligations in this agreement if HudHosting's contact information for the Customer is out of date or inaccurate due to the Customer's action or omission or if HudHosting's failure is due to reasons of Force Majeure or other circumstances beyond HudHosting's reasonable control (as defined in clause 13 of these terms).</p>
					<h2>6. Commencement and Initial Period of Service</h2>
					<p>The Service shall be for an initial period as specified on the Order Form (where completed). The Service, unless otherwise agreed on the Order Form (where completed), shall be provided for an Initial Contract Term of twelve months. The Initial Contract Term shall commence upon connection. Connection shall be deemed to be effected when the link is first live to the your Site or other such point as requested by you, to the HudHosting network.</p>
					<h2>7. Bandwidth Utilisation</h2>
					<p>If the bandwidth or speed of Service used by you exceeds agreed quotas in a one month minimum period an excess charge will be payable by you at current published prices.</p>
					<h2>8. Content and Misuse</h2>
					<p>8.1 You will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the HudHosting Service is used or includes content that conforms to the laws of this country and will not knowingly permit any illegal use or such use that will bring HudHosting into disrepute.</p>
					<p>8.2 You must not, nor must any other person, use the Service: to send or receive any material which is offensive, abusive, indecent, obscene, pornographic or menacing, or in breach of confidence, copyright, privacy or any other rights, to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety, or in breach of any provisions as contained within clauses 3 and 4 of this Contract, or other than in conformance with the acceptable use policies of any connected networks and the Internet standards.</p>
					<h2>9. Charges and Payment</h2>
					<p>The Client agrees to pay the charges on the following terms:-</p>
					<p>9.1 All Charges shall become due and payable to HudHosting at the times and the stages specified in the Payment Schedule on the order form.</p>
					<p>9.2 The Client shall pay any additional charges which are agreed between HudHosting and the Client for the provision of the Services within 14 days after completion of the Services and the Client shall also pay such additional charges which are in HudHosting's sole discretion required as a result of the Client's instructions or lack of instructions, delay in providing or the inaccuracy of any Supplied Material or any other cause attributable to the Client</p>
					<p>9.3 In the event of late payment the Client shall pay interest on the amount of the Charges outstanding at the rate of 7% above the base lending rate from time to time of National Westminster Bank plc</p>
					<p>9.4 If any payment remains overdue HudHosting reserves the right to immediately remove the Client's Hosting from viewing on the Internet and to suspend all other work until payment of all outstanding charges and interest is made. Such removal or withholding does not relieve the Client of his or her obligation to pay any outstanding Charges and interest. If such a suspension is imposed, you will be liable for a "reconnection" charge of up to £200.</p>
					<p>9.5 The Client shall be liable for and shall indemnify HudHosting against all costs and expenses incurred by HudHosting in respect of any steps, actions or proceedings made or brought against the Client by HudHosting to obtain payment of outstanding Charges and interest</p>

					<p>9.7 You acknowledge that our Services are provided using facilities provided to us by third parties; HudHosting shall have the right, subject to 14 days prior written notice to you, to increase our Charges at any time during the Initial Contract Term or any Extension Term, whether to reflect increase costs to us from such third parties or otherwise. However, if such increase exceeds 10% of the Charge in question prior to such notice you shall be entitled to terminate the Contract by written notice to us given by you within 7 days after service of our notice of increase to you. If you do so terminate, you will remain liable for all Charges (at the previous rate) up to the date the Contract ends.</p>
					<h2>10. Default</h2>
					<p>10.1 If you do not pay the charges in accordance with the provisions of clause 9 of this Contract, or break this Contract in any other way, or are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings HudHosting can (without prejudicing, losing or reducing any other right or remedy) suspend Service, wholly or partially, without notice (but the User remains liable during the suspension to pay charges for Service), or terminate this Contract by immediate notice, without prejudice to HudHostings pre-existing rights.</p>
					<p>10.2 Bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding means bankruptcy proceedings or in Scotland sequestration proceedings, becoming insolvent, making any composition or arrangement with creditors or an assignment for their benefit, any execution, distress, diligence or seizure: or if the User is a company, being the subject of proceedings for the appointment of an administrator, going into liquidation whether voluntary or compulsory (except for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction) or having a receiver or administrative receiver of any assets appointed.</p>
					<p>10.3 You continue to be liable to pay all charges which are due for Service during any period in which you do not comply with this Contract.</p>
					<p>10.4 On termination of this Agreement or suspension of the Services we shall be entitled immediately to block your Hosting and to remove all data located on it. We shall be entitled to delete all such data but we may at our discretion hold such data for such period as we may decide, to allow you to collect it at your expense, subject to payment in full of any amounts withstanding and payable to us. We shall further be entitled to post such notice in respect of the non-availability of your Hosting as we think fit.</p>
					<p>10.5 For so long as any sum due to HudHosting hereunder is unpaid or any other amount is due to or properly claimed by HudHosting from you for services or goods supplied or for any other reason, whether pursuant to these terms or otherwise, HudHosting shall be entitled to retain any property owned by you or lawfully in your custody or possession and which is held by HudHosting or by its agents until such time as all amounts due to HudHosting are paid and/or any issue between you and HudHosting is determined.</p>
					<p>10.6 If HudHosting waives a breach of Contract by you, that waiver is limited to that particular breach. Any delay by HudHosting in acting upon a breach is not to be regarded in itself as a waiver.</p>
					<h2>11. Termination of Service</h2>
					<p>11.1 Service may be terminated by either party on giving at least 30 days notice to the other expiring on the last day of the Initial Contract Term or at any time thereafter. If HudHosting gives notice you shall pay all charges up to the expiry of the notice. If you give notice, you shall pay all charges as provided in subclause 9.</p>
					<p>11.2 HudHosting reserves the right during the Initial Contract Term and at any time thereafter to terminate this Contract by giving to you not less than 30 days prior written notice of termination.</p>
					<p>11.3 After the expiry of the Initial Contract Term you may terminate the Service by giving not less than 30 days prior written notice of termination, but subject to subclause 11.4.</p>
					<p>11.4. Your notice does not avoid any other liability for Service already provided.</p>
					<p>11.5 The Contract is a yearly contract and if you continue Service beyond your Initial Contract Term you will be liable to pay for the remainder of the then current Extension Term even though Service ends before the end of the Extension Term.</p>
					<h2>12. Notices</h2>
					<p>Any notice to be given by either party to the other may be sent by either email or recorded delivery to the address of the other party as appearing in this Agreement or the Order Form or such other address as such party may from time to time have communicated to the other in writing, and if sent by email shall unless the contrary is proved be deemed to be received on the day it was sent or if sent by recorded delivery shall be deemed to be served two days following the date of posting.</p>
